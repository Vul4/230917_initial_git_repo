# R P3.2  to create a list

Trying to help you a bit below with a step-by-step solution

```{r}
# First: make the table
before_diet = c(104, 95, 87, 77, 112)
after_diet = c(96, 91, 81, 75, 118)
subjectName = c("subject_1", "subject_2", "subject_3", "subject_4", "subject_5")
table.diet<-data.frame(before_diet, after_diet)
#define rownames as subjectnames
rownames(table.diet)<-subjectName
table.diet

## subject_after_diet.c = as.double(subject_after_diet)
## numberOfSubject = 5

# Second: weight_loss

weight_loss <- before_diet-after_diet # subject_weight_loss = c(8, 4, 6, 2, -6)


# Third: the message

message<- 'it is really a headache but I hope I could master it'
# keep working hard, and by trying and you will eventually master it.



# Fourth: the WEIGHT_LOSS list

WEIGHT_LOSS = list(
  "subject" = subjectName,
  "weight_loss" = weight_loss,
  "table" = data.frame(subjectName, weight_loss)
)


# Fifth: the BUBBLE_DIET list


BUBBLE_DIET = list(
  "Table_diet" = table.diet,
  "Info_weight_loss" = WEIGHT_LOSS,
  "Message" = message
    )

print(BUBBLE_DIET)
```

Easy, easy :)
